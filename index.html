    <h1>Ethical Hacking Study Community</h1>
    <p><strong>Read this before participating.</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      If you are able to see this page, I want to congratulate you for taking a bold step.
      This community was built for people who already have some knowledge in ethical hacking
      and want to level up.
    </p>

    <p>
      My name is Winston, and I am the founder of this community. I have been an ethical hacker
      for over five years and have worked on many real-world projects and scenarios that I am
      excited to teach you. I am also known as <strong>@officialwhyte</strong> on X (formerly Twitter),
      where I post daily projects and polls.
    </p>

    <p>
      I strongly encourage you to take both the projects and polls seriously. This is a focused
      and disciplined learning environment. Members who remain inactive over time may be removed
      to make room for those who are ready to learn and contribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      I host weekly AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions where you can ask direct questions, as well as
      live hacking demonstrations. I am also available to students who consistently complete tasks
      and contribute meaningfully to the community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that access to me is reserved for members who take their growth seriously.
      If tasks are not completed and there is no contribution, access will be limited.
      This helps me focus my time on committed learners.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Community Is</h2>
    <p>
      This is a focused ethical hacking and cybersecurity learning community.
      It is built for people who already understand the basics and want to improve
      through real explanations, hands-on labs, and structured projects.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>This is NOT:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A beginner helpdesk</li>
        <li>A motivational or hype-based community</li>
        <li>A place for spam, greetings, or off-topic discussion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Learning and contribution matter more than noise.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>How Learning Works Here</h2>
    <p>
      Learning is structured in <strong>days</strong> and <strong>projects</strong>.
      Each learning day may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A short lecture (TXT or PDF)</li>
      <li>A hands-on task mainly using Kali Linux</li>
      <li>A poll or short check-in</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Projects are practical and designed to show how real attacks and defenses work.
      You are expected to read instructions carefully and follow them step by step.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects & Materials</h2>
    <p>
      All projects, tasks, and shared materials are stored in one place.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>📂 Google Drive (Projects & Materials)</strong></p>
      <p>
        👉 <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kZNV3ud4eUmp-380HN4dKROa41iHEo8W?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">
        Click here to access all projects
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Always check this drive for the latest updates.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>How to Submit Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      When a project requires submission:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Send screenshots and answers directly to the admin’s DM</li>
      <li>Do NOT post screenshots or answers in the group</li>
      <li>Submissions without screenshots or explanations are not reviewed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Always read the submission instructions inside each project carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Read shared materials fully</li>
      <li>Attempt tasks before asking questions</li>
      <li>Contribute only when you understand what you are saying</li>
      <li>Maintain professional behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Note</h2>
    <p>
      This community is built for long-term learning.
      If you stay consistent, you will grow.
      If you only observe without effort, you will fall behind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take your time. Read properly. Learn deeply.
